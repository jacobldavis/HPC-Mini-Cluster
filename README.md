# HPC-Mini-Cluster
My procedure for setting up the HPC Mini-Cluster for ECE 4990.

## Getting Started
Before beginning, collect the necessary materials of the Pi Cluster Kit, including the Raspberry Pi's, micro SD card, power cables, ethernet cables, network switch, and power supply.

To start, start cabling everything up. Make sure to plug in the power supply and network switch to the wall power, and connect the pis to the power supply and network switches. I recommend following this [link](https://epcced.github.io/wee_archlet/#intro) for the hardware setup.
